|**09/18/15 12:07**|  *himanshu*| This event is really sad.  <https://www.facebook.com/notes/iit-kharagpur/iit-kharagpur-student-dies-due-to-lack-of-adequate-medical-facility-outraged-stu/76000961022>    Scholars' Avenue was banned for putting up an article about it  <https://www.quora.com/What-was-it-like-for-The-Scholars-Avenue-to-get-banned-for-several-months-in-the-early-stages-of-its-inception>| 
|**09/18/15 13:06**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AKU18CW>: Do you know who was the diro and the deputy diro then?     <http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article338886.ece>| 
|**09/18/15 13:06**|  *icyflame*| this article suggests that a `Mr. Chakraborty` was the deputy diro. Was PPC the deputy diro then?| 
|**09/18/15 13:20**|  *himanshu*| Page 12 : <http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/downloads/iitkgp_09_10.pdf>  The Deputy Director was Prof. Mrityunjoy Chakraborty| 
|**09/18/15 13:22**|  *amrav*| We should put up an article on the wiki about this incident. Theres lots of news sources to cite.| 
|**09/18/15 13:22**|  *himanshu*| yes| 
|**09/18/15 13:22**|  *amrav*| Alternatively, put it on the BC Roy page.| 
|**09/18/15 13:23**|  *himanshu*| In the history section| 
|**09/18/15 13:23**|  *amrav*| In the Incompetency section.| 
|**09/18/15 13:24**|  *himanshu*| Yeah that seems better| 
|**09/18/15 13:38**|  *himanshu*| Sorry, the deputy director was Madhusudan Chakraborty  <https://web.archive.org/web/20090707022918/http://iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=YVmdQ&amp;depts_name=DD>| 
|**09/18/15 13:58**|  *himanshu*| I'm a little confused| 
|**09/18/15 13:59**|  *himanshu*| I don't think the banning of TSA and the incident is related| 
|**09/18/15 13:59**|  *himanshu*| That TSA article is of 2005 and the Hindu is of 2009| 
|**09/18/15 13:59**|  *himanshu*| So, we have two articles now in that section| 
|**09/18/15 14:45**|  *himanshu*| I have put up the article. Please see and edit for a better language or more informtion.  <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/BC_Roy_Technology_Hospital>| 
|**09/18/15 15:56**|  *dementor*| I dont think it should be called incompetence| 
|**09/18/15 15:56**|  *dementor*| It should be called Past Incidents| 
|**09/18/15 15:56**|  *dementor*| or Criticism| 
|**09/18/15 16:03**|  *amrav*| I was kidding about Incompetence :-P | 
|**09/18/15 16:03**|  *amrav*| You can put it under a Controversies section, like Wikipedia. | 
|**09/18/15 19:35**|  *xtinct*| Yeah.| 
|**09/18/15 19:35**|  *xtinct*| Controversies should do.| 
|**09/19/15 14:41**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AKU18CW>: I have made some changes to the page. There is a list of the doctors available at every shift, that changes every month.    If we could have it on the page, than that would be very helpful. <@U0AHQ8HD3> , <@U0AJEBGBU> , <@U0AHSU2KF> Any idea about how we may be able to achieve this?| 
|**09/19/15 14:46**|  *hargup*| once a month isn't too frequent,  someone can click the photograph of the shift schedule every month and post it.| 
|**09/19/15 14:46**|  *icyflame*| No issues, it seems it is posted here ```<http://noticeboard.iitkgp.ernet.in/bcrth/>```| 
|**09/19/15 14:47**|  *icyflame*| Actually, the schedule changes once a week. Sorry about that.| 
|**09/19/15 14:48**|  *icyflame*| We can put a link to this notice board in the infobox.| 
|**09/19/15 15:39**|  *himanshu*| People! The note of 2009, has been deleted by the page of IIT Kharagpur!| 
|**09/19/15 15:39**|  *himanshu*| It was there yesterday| 
|**09/19/15 15:40**|  *himanshu*| That was unexpected| 
|**09/19/15 15:40**|  *himanshu*| And I think I am the culprit because I discovered it and 'liked' it which spread it among people and they 'liked' it too which drew the attention :disappointed:| 
|**09/19/15 15:48**|  *dementor*| Note of 2009?| 
|**09/19/15 15:48**|  *dementor*| What are we talking about?| 
|**09/19/15 15:49**|  *dementor*| And deleted by IIT Khargpur? Am I missing something?| 
|**09/19/15 15:49**|  *nuwanda*| BCRoy wala| 
|**09/19/15 15:49**|  *dementor*| note? Deleted from where?| 
|**09/19/15 15:49**|  *himanshu*| facebook page| 
|**09/19/15 15:49**|  *nuwanda*| I think the IIT kharapur page was handled by somebody else. And was taken over by the admin/VP| 
|**09/19/15 15:50**|  *nuwanda*| So, older posts are not that neutral. :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/19/15 15:50**|  *dementor*| You put a note on IIT Kharagpur fb page?| 
|**09/19/15 15:51**|  *dementor*| How?| 
|**09/19/15 15:51**|  *dementor*| And its handled by PR chair| 
|**09/19/15 15:51**|  *himanshu*| No, they had put it in 2009| 
|**09/19/15 15:51**|  *himanshu*| Just after the event| 
|**09/19/15 15:51**|  *dementor*| Oh| 
|**09/19/15 15:51**|  *dementor*| And it got deleted :O dafuq :O| 
|**09/19/15 15:52**|  *himanshu*| The info under controversies <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/BC_Roy_Technology_Hospital>  was taken from there| 
|**09/19/15 15:52**|  *himanshu*| And now we are left with only The Hindu's news| 
|**09/19/15 15:52**|  *dementor*| I see. You should write this there then.| 
|**09/19/15 15:52**|  *dementor*| That it was removed.| 
|**09/19/15 15:53**|  *dementor*| But that was expected.| 
|**09/19/15 15:54**|  *dementor*| IIT Kgp does not want parents of 1st years to know about this shit obviously.| 
|**09/19/15 15:54**|  *icyflame*| The text of that note was picked up from this blog post: <http://shrey-knows.blogspot.in/2009/03/death-of-iitian.html>| 
|**09/19/15 15:55**|  *dementor*| shrey-knows Sounds so apt :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/19/15 15:58**|  *icyflame*| I think we should put a note regarding the fact that the post was removed from the facebook page| 
|**09/19/15 16:03**|  *dementor*| Yep| 
|**09/19/15 16:10**|  *amrav*| Did we not archive the facebook post?| 
|**09/19/15 16:10**|  *amrav*| Especially for controversial topics, thats the first thing we should do.| 
|**09/19/15 16:18**|  *himanshu*| Now I got to know that we can also save a page. I thought the machine does it on their own| 
|**09/19/15 16:19**|  *himanshu*| Shit| 
|**09/19/15 18:55**|  *himanshu*| I just went to the grocery shop of my hall(LLR) to buy some things and I just asked when it was found.. he kept me telling things and I came to know that the student who died was from our hall. And at that time, the deputy directory who had said "What's the big deal" was the warden of the hall.| 
|**09/19/15 18:55**|  *himanshu*| This is shocking... I came to know about many other stories. But I didn't had a phone to record them.| 
|**09/19/15 18:56**|  *himanshu*| It felt good, to talk.| 
|**09/20/15 08:00**|  *twistin*| <@U0AKU18CW>: that is coool.|
