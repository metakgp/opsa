|**09/15/15 16:41**|  *dementor*| Hey, What are we asking for from people for photographs?| 
|**09/15/15 16:42**|  *dementor*| I know Asid maybe I can ask him.| 
|**09/15/15 16:42**|  *dementor*| Also, Mrinal might have photos too.| 
|**09/15/15 16:42**|  *dementor*| But what exactly are we looking for?| 
|**09/15/15 16:44**|  *dementor*| <https://www.facebook.com/Asidity/photos_stream>| 
|**09/15/15 16:44**|  *dementor*| Check this| 
|**09/15/15 16:44**|  *dementor*| He has a brilliant collection :open_mouth:| 
|**09/15/15 16:45**|  *dementor*| WTMS, Choreo, Random Kgp| 
|**09/15/15 17:16**|  *hargup*| We want to have galleries of Illu, Rangoli, SF and KTJ of different years| 
|**09/15/15 17:17**|  *hargup*| and also the photographs of different buildings and places| 
|**09/15/15 17:19**|  *hargup*| including photos like this one <https://www.facebook.com/Asidity/photos/pb.479112958824831.-2207520000.1442317499./740204012715723/?type=3&amp;theater>| 
|**09/15/15 17:59**|  *dementor*| Asid wants to know which pictures and he will upload them.| 
|**09/15/15 18:00**|  *dementor*| Is there someone who wont mind goign through the huge albums on Fb and give the list| 
|**09/15/15 18:00**|  *dementor*| *going| 
|**09/15/15 18:05**|  *dementor*| Ok so I did this myself and asked him to upload the following albums :| 
|**09/15/15 18:05**|  *dementor*| 1. Illumination 2013  2. KGP  3. SF 2014  4. CHoreo  5. Best of WTMS  6. SF 2015| 
|**09/15/15 18:16**|  *dementor*| SO he says its pointless to upload albums| 
|**09/15/15 18:17**|  *dementor*| since we won't be using all| 
|**09/15/15 18:17**|  *dementor*| So, he says to decide exact pics| 
|**09/15/15 18:17**|  *dementor*| and he will do them| 
|**09/15/15 21:19**|  *hargup*| <@U0AHSU2KF>: can you update the status for Nikesh|

|**09/18/15 18:07**|  *amrav*| Does anyone have any idea how we can get photographs of GC 2014-15 events?| 
|**09/18/15 18:25**|  *nuwanda*| Any of you know the current/previous photography secretaries?| 
|**09/18/15 18:25**|  *nuwanda*| It will be really good if we work on this quickly. And get the Photographs released.| 
|**09/18/15 18:26**|  *nuwanda*| I can talk to Atal if we know what we want from the admin. Let's talk to the secy and find out how/where they store the images.| 
|**09/18/15 18:54**|  *dementor*| Asid is on campus and he wants us to give him the list soon| 
|**09/18/15 18:54**|  *dementor*| since he has fast net here| 
|**09/18/15 18:54**|  *dementor*| :confused:| 
|**09/18/15 19:36**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AKGKRST>: What are we waiting for. Let's grab the most of the it.| 
|**09/18/15 19:36**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AJEBGBU>: Any updates on when Subhjoy is going to upload the photos of night canteens, if not done already| 
|**09/18/15 19:37**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHSU2KF> Can you help me in making a list. There are too many pictures to go through. :confused:| 
|**09/18/15 19:37**|  *hargup*| He'll edit the photographs this weekend and then we can add them| 
|**09/18/15 19:37**|  *xtinct*| Yeah. Please post the link here. We all can help.| 
|**09/18/15 19:37**|  *hargup*| yup|

|**09/18/15 19:38**|  *dementor*| <https://www.facebook.com/Asidity/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums>| 
|**09/18/15 19:39**|  *xtinct*| Also, can you please mark which albums you are sorting so that we don't duplicate work?| 
|**09/18/15 19:40**|  *dementor*| I am yet to start.| 
|**09/18/15 19:40**|  *dementor*| You can divide and tell me.|

|**09/18/15 19:43**|  *xtinct*| KGP, Illu, SF remain.| 
|**09/18/15 19:43**|  *xtinct*| There could be interesting photos in other albums as well.| 
|**09/18/15 19:44**|  *hargup*| Choreo is small I'll go after Illu then|

|**09/18/15 20:46**|  *dementor*| I am sending it to Asid| 
|**09/18/15 21:34**|  *dementor*| Done - <https://www.flickr.com/photos/dreamerasid/>| 
|**09/18/15 21:35**|  *dementor*| He did as many as he could find.| 
|**09/18/15 21:35**|  *dementor*| There should actually be a wiki page about Asid :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/18/15 21:58**|  *xtinct*| Their Madness Project too.| 
|**09/18/15 22:02**|  *xtinct*| initiates transfer to commons| 
|**09/18/15 22:02**|  *xtinct*| But it's really nice of him to do this so promptly. Great guy.| 
|**09/18/15 22:06**|  *xtinct*| <https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:ListFiles/Vivek_Rai&amp;ilshowall=1>| 
|**09/18/15 22:07**|  *dementor*| :smile:| 
|**09/18/15 23:06**|  *himanshu*| The photography secretary, Abhineet Chute is a friend of mine. How can I help with this?| 
|**09/19/15 08:43**|  *nuwanda*| <@U0AKU18CW>:  Could you ask him what is the procedure for him to release the pictures?| 
|**09/19/15 08:43**|  *nuwanda*| If we figure out that mechanism, we don't have to struggle for a lot of photographs.| 
|**09/19/15 15:04**|  *himanshu*| I talked to him and he said he can bring out those pictures and all clicked by his friends| 
|**09/19/15 15:05**|  *himanshu*| Can anyone add him in the chat?  <mailto:abz.shady@gmail.com abz.shady@gmail.com>| 
|**09/19/15 16:14**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKU18CW>: We cant add people to a single channel in a free Slack account. Can he be trusted to do the right thing, or is he too shady?| 
|**09/19/15 16:17**|  *dementor*| ^lol| 
|**09/19/15 16:18**|  *himanshu*| :smile: Me and <@U0AHU8RU0> had a chat with him on hangouts| 
|**09/19/15 16:24**|  *himanshu*| GC images were clicked by last year's secy. He'll take images from her and upload it soon| 
|**09/20/15 11:44**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AKGKRST>: Can you again ask Siddharth to release some photos of Madness project? :smile:| 
|**09/20/15 11:44**|  *xtinct*| and if possible, select some cool ones for it.| 
|**09/20/15 11:44**|  *xtinct*| I have created a page about it| 
|**09/20/15 11:45**|  *dementor*| I think I saw them under CC alrady| 
|**09/20/15 11:45**|  *dementor*| Tried googling?| 
|**09/20/15 11:45**|  *xtinct*| Not yet. Let me see| 
|**09/20/15 11:49**|  *xtinct*| umm.. cannot find.| 
|**09/21/15 02:05**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: <@U0AKGKRST> What is the license for images uploaded to Facebook by Awaaz IIT KGP ?| 
|**09/21/15 02:06**|  *icyflame*| Can I upload them under CC license and reference them in a page?| 
|**09/21/15 02:06**|  *icyflame*| Specifically, <https://scontent.fdel1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10570487_799251116761912_4955392668226989644_n.jpg?oh=ce3048bcdabe896483d697663a42d576&amp;oe=569F1A0B>| 
|**09/21/15 02:07**|  *amrav*| I dont think anyone has asked Awaaz whether their stuff is CC.| 
|**09/21/15 02:07**|  *amrav*| You can go ahead and ask them.| 
|**09/21/15 02:07**|  *amrav*| In any case, you can certainly cite that image as a source, even without asking.| 
|**09/21/15 11:58**|  *xtinct*| <@U0APA9ZUP>: In such cases, you can just look at their data and create a graph of your own. Which should be a task of 5 mins.| 
|**09/21/15 11:58**|  *xtinct*| That becomes your work then! :smile:| 
|**09/21/15 11:59**|  *icyflame*| Hah, yeah. That would be easy to do too. :smile:| 
|**09/21/15 11:59**|  *icyflame*| Graphs are not internal to Wiki itself, right?| 
|**09/21/15 11:59**|  *xtinct*| I guess.| 
|**09/21/15 12:00**|  *icyflame*| Hmm, okay. I can probably extend the Contributors graph easily to graph data that is fed by the user :simple_smile:| 
|**09/21/15 12:03**|  *xtinct*| <@U0APA9ZUP>: Also, for pages where we have to put a year wise history of say governors or office bearers, I think it'd be pretty okay to just put the current one on main article and rest on a page title 'List of office bearers for CDC', for example.| 
|**09/21/15 12:03**|  *xtinct*| And then just link to that list within the section.| 
|**09/21/15 12:10**|  *icyflame*| Yeah, sure, I will change the list accordingly. Otherwise, the CDC page becomes unnecessarily long, you are right.|
