|**09/16/15 17:51**|  *xtinct*| Vim's tabularize plugin can help ease some pain with glorious wiki table markup.| 
|**09/16/15 17:56**|  *hargup*| will check it out| 
|**09/16/15 18:52**|  *amrav*| MediaWiki 1.25 + VisualEditor latest master has support for editing tables.| 
|**09/16/15 18:52**|  *amrav*| Migrating to 1.25 will be a giant pain in the ass. Its probably necessary though.|

|**09/16/15 20:58**|  *dementor*| Has anyone used slack on phone using vpn or any other way?| 
|**09/16/15 21:00**|  *mitpal*| Yes. I'm using phone at the moment. | 
|**09/16/15 21:00**|  *mitpal*| Using VPN. | 
|**09/16/15 21:00**|  *dementor*| It works right?| 
|**09/16/15 21:01**|  *dementor*| Cool. I am considering shifting from google groups to this at some places.| 
|**09/16/15 21:01**|  *dementor*| Any issiues you faced?| 
|**09/16/15 21:03**|  *mitpal*| Yes it world. No issues as of now. Only problem is you have to get connected to VPN. | 
|**09/16/15 21:03**|  *mitpal*| *works| 
|**09/16/15 21:04**|  *dementor*| That's true for whatsapp notifications too for that matter so people use it anyways.|

|**09/18/15 01:52**|  *hargup*| cool|

|**09/20/15 00:52**|  *dementor*| Anyone knows if we can put a ppt in markdown?| 
|**09/20/15 01:40**|  *icyflame*| AFAIK markdown doesn't have any way to achieve page breaks    So slide shows would be a bit hard. Of course if you don't mind scrolling, then yeah!| 
|**09/20/15 01:50**|  *dementor*| Na. I got it. The best way is to put a pic of the first slide and then link it to the slideshare page.|

|**09/20/15 15:35**|  *xtinct*| They did this last time to, helping me bump my space to 27 GB.| 
|**09/20/15 15:35**|  *xtinct*| But now, after an year (or 2 years maybe) it has expired causing my account to overflow! :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 20:07**|  *xtinct*| What's the cheapest b&amp;w/color print rate I can get in KGP and where?| 
|**09/20/15 20:09**|  *dementor*| 4 rs is the cheapest I have seen.| 
|**09/20/15 20:09**|  *dementor*| for print| 
|**09/20/15 20:09**|  *dementor*| Cheapest would be buying your own printer or using Dept printer :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/21/15 00:49**|  *dementor*| <@U0AKWDA9H> Studying maths makes you feel like being in Greenland?|
