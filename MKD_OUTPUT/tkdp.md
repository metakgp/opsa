|**09/14/15 21:35**|  *whiplash*| Start with the barber on PAN loop. He takes his time with the haircut, but he's a treasure trove of stories. You'll need more than one haircut to get it all out of him.| 
|**09/14/15 21:36**|  *amrav*| Haha :simple_smile:| 
|**09/14/15 21:39**|  *whiplash*| I'd have done this if I was still there. I used to go to him. And this was something I always wanted to do.| 
|**09/14/15 21:40**|  *amrav*| Maybe when you visit campus, we can interview him?| 
|**09/14/15 21:40**|  *amrav*| (which is hopefully soon? :P)| 
|**09/14/15 21:46**|  *whiplash*| <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Metakgp_talk:KGP_Documentation_Project>| 
|**09/14/15 21:46**|  *whiplash*| Haha, maybe. :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/14/15 21:48**|  *whiplash*| Search/ask for anecdotes. That's what people want to read, eventually.| 
|**09/14/15 21:52**|  *hargup*| yup, we all love good stories. btw we plan to record them talking.| 
|**09/14/15 21:56**|  *amrav*| Itll be an interview. Hopefully itll be interesting enough to release as a podcast. BTW, check out <https://www.youtube.com/user/blankonblank>|

|**09/14/15 22:05**|  *whiplash*| I've seen Blank on Blank. Really cool stuff.| 
|**09/14/15 22:06**|  *whiplash*| Podcast is bonus content though. People who do the interview can release it under the 'KGP Oral History Project', IMO. Would be really cool.| 
|**09/14/15 22:33**|  *hargup*| That's a much better name, I'm changing the name| 
|**09/14/15 22:41**|  *amrav*| I like tkdp more :P| 
|**09/14/15 22:47**|  *whiplash*| tkdp is nice. :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/14/15 22:49**|  *hargup*| okay we have majority for tkdp, it also resembles our beloved tldp|
