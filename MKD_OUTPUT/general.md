|**09/13/15 14:32**|  *xtinct*| The current and the future batch will never know about the R U OK? day organized in IIT Kharagpur, the mass blackout for 1 hour and the fun people had. The information we are losing is unprecedented. If you quickly can compile an article on this, it could serve as an interesting and popular DYK article for people.| 
|**09/13/15 15:24**|  *xtinct*| <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Reach_Out_Week>| 
|**09/13/15 15:24**|  *xtinct*| With whatever I could scavenge.| 
|**09/13/15 15:25**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AHU8RU0>: Would Schol Ave have any pictures of Reach Out Week?| 
|**09/13/15 15:27**|  *xtinct*| Infact, we should try to have all SWG pictures (and institute photos) released with suitable license.| 
|**09/14/15 17:42**|  *hargup*| Hi| 
|**09/14/15 17:42**|  *hargup*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: Firefox club was mainly for promotion of firefox and attracting its developers| 
|**09/14/15 17:50**|  *amrav*| This is better because we can start new channels for different workstreams, and coordinate better.| 
|**09/14/15 17:50**|  *amrav*| <@U0AHSU2KF>: The slack app works fine for me on Desktop - did you mean mobile?| 
|**09/14/15 17:50**|  *xtinct*| Yeah.| 
|**09/14/15 17:51**|  *dementor*| <@U0AKGKRST dementor> has joined the channel| 
|**09/14/15 17:52**|  *xtinct*| As far as opening the map location in Google map is considered, I think there's a {{coord}} template that allows embedding location coordinates in the article, which can be opened with suitable app.| 
|**09/14/15 17:55**|  *amrav*| Hmm. I wish the Slack app worked over the proxy, but I think the other useful features it provides probably still makes it worth it.| 
|**09/14/15 17:56**|  *amrav*| I wish people not on Slack could just go to <http://metakgp.slack.com metakgp.slack.com>, and participate (at least in <#C0AHUF5R7>)| 
|**09/14/15 17:57**|  *amrav*| Like IRC| 
|**09/14/15 17:57**|  *dementor*| How does it work fine in browser?| 
|**09/14/15 17:57**|  *dementor*| It fails to connect for me on browser too| 
|**09/14/15 17:58**|  *xtinct*| I remember having such issue in KLUG thread.| 
|**09/14/15 17:58**|  *xtinct*| Please check if you have something in your socks proxy field.| 
|**09/14/15 17:58**|  *xtinct*| If yes, delete it.| 
|**09/14/15 17:58**|  *xtinct*| It should work fine then.| 
|**09/14/15 18:02**|  *dementor*| Cool. SOlved.| 
|**09/14/15 18:02**|  *dementor*| This is cool.| 
|**09/14/15 18:02**|  *dementor*| So, we should have different rooms for different pages.| 
|**09/14/15 18:02**|  *dementor*| Or Channels for that matter.| 
|**09/14/15 18:03**|  *amrav*| We can have different channels (which are like rooms) for different work streams. If many pages come under the same work stream, they can all go into the same channel.| 
|**09/14/15 18:04**|  *xtinct*| Let's say we are working on the _page of the week_, then we can dedicate a channel for all its related discussion.| 
|**09/14/15 18:04**|  *amrav*| Yep.| 
|**09/14/15 18:10**|  *amrav*| This is fun: <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Special:ContributionScores>| 
|**09/14/15 18:10**|  *xtinct*| Seems like I'm being approached very steadily :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/14/15 18:11**|  *dementor*| Ahh! It's exam time. I will catchup. :smile:| 
|**09/14/15 18:12**|  *amrav*| I cant believe Ive been surpassed on all time contributions :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/14/15 18:13**|  *amrav*| <@U0AHQ8HD3 amrav> pinned a message to this channel.| 
|**09/14/15 18:14**|  *dementor*| Oh Oh Make a Chart of this Real TIme| 
|**09/14/15 18:14**|  *dementor*| using 3djs| 
|**09/14/15 18:14**|  *dementor*| and put in on the main page :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/14/15 18:18**|  *amrav*| Can everyone please add other members of the Metakgp team whose email ids you know, to this slack?| 
|**09/14/15 18:18**|  *dementor*| ok So, I wanted to discuss how to decide what page should be a metakgp wiki and where we should link to an external website?| 
|**09/14/15 18:19**|  *dementor*| I think there should be a fixed criteria to decide this.| 
|**09/14/15 18:20**|  *amrav*| I think the criteria is roughly: If something is important by itself, it should be on the wiki, either as a page, or as  a section on a page, depending on how much information there is. External links should only be used as references.| 
|**09/14/15 18:20**|  *dementor*| "important" needs to be objective| 
|**09/14/15 18:20**|  *dementor*| I think we should not have wikis of profs| 
|**09/14/15 18:21**|  *dementor*| But, then| 
|**09/14/15 18:21**|  *dementor*| we should have too considering we might want to put information on how good/bad tehy are and courses they take| 
|**09/14/15 18:21**|  *dementor*| eventually| 
|**09/14/15 18:21**|  *dementor*| Things like this and should we have a TSG wiki| 
|**09/14/15 18:22**|  *dementor*| or we can just link teh TSG page| 
|**09/14/15 18:22**|  *amrav*| I think the bar for important is: is any editor willing to take the trouble to create a page for that topic. An external link is the easiest thing to do, second easiest is a section on an existing page, and highest effort is a new page.| 
|**09/14/15 18:23**|  *amrav*| If theres a lot of information to put about a prof, especially from across multiple sources, I would definitely want to write a wiki page about him/her.| 
|**09/14/15 18:23**|  *dementor*| What about TSG?| 
|**09/14/15 18:24**|  *amrav*| TSG should definitely have its own wiki page.| 
|**09/14/15 18:24**|  *dementor*| hmm.| 
|**09/14/15 18:24**|  *amrav*| Theres a lot of stuff to write about TSG.| 
|**09/14/15 18:24**|  *whiplash*| <@U0AKJ9GET whiplash> has joined the channel| 
|**09/14/15 18:25**|  *dementor*| Interesting.| 
|**09/14/15 18:25**|  *amrav*| Ive added Adarsh to the team. He graduated this year, but has vast experience about KGP, and a ton of other things too numerous to mention right now.| 
|**09/14/15 18:25**|  *dementor*| Ok 1. I think we should have meta-kgp X-Labs Page| 
|**09/14/15 18:33**|  *amrav*| Yeah, for sure!| 
|**09/14/15 18:33**|  *amrav*| Also, does anyone know Siddharth Kannan?| 
|**09/14/15 18:34**|  *dementor*| I don't know him personally but I have met him.| 
|**09/14/15 18:34**|  *dementor*| AUV CS Guy I think| 
|**09/14/15 18:35**|  *dementor*| Mech guy :open_mouth:| 
|**09/14/15 18:43**|  *nuwanda*| <@U0AHSU2KF>: TSA rarely owns images. We ask friends and share with credits| 
|**09/14/15 18:48**|  *nuwanda*| Let's start some threads for various things we have planned in the immediate future?| 
|**09/14/15 18:49**|  *dementor*| +1| 
|**09/14/15 18:57**|  *dementor*| @Vikrant how do I upload images?|

|**09/14/15 19:06**|  *dementor*| Oh!| 
|**09/14/15 19:06**|  *dementor*| Also, <@U0AHQ8HD3>  Did you go through the page? What all is needed to get it featured| 
|**09/14/15 19:06**|  *dementor*| ?| 
|**09/14/15 19:07**|  *abhishek*| hey| 
|**09/14/15 19:07**|  *amrav*| Hey <@U0AKR593L>| 
|**09/14/15 19:08**|  *dementor*| Also, <@U0AKR593L> I was planning to write a page on HM. Can you help me with it?| 
|**09/14/15 19:08**|  *dementor*| I would need all HMs of past from all halls if they are willing to share images/documentation.| 
|**09/14/15 19:09**|  *abhishek*| is the page there yet?| 
|**09/14/15 19:09**|  *dementor*| Nopes| 
|**09/14/15 19:09**|  *dementor*| We do ot have the relevant info yet| 
|**09/14/15 19:09**|  *dementor*| *not| 
|**09/14/15 19:10**|  *dementor*| There is too much to cover in that actually and it will be brilliant if we can cover it all.| 
|**09/14/15 19:10**|  *dementor*| or even 3 years in past.| 
|**09/14/15 19:11**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKGKRST>: I have to make some edits for structure and consistency. Ill do it tomorrow (after bioinformatics), or <@U0AJEBGBU> , <@U0AHSU2KF> or anyone else can pitch in too.| 
|**09/14/15 19:11**|  *dementor*| Oh!| 
|**09/14/15 19:11**|  *dementor*| Then I will move to a new pag for today.| 
|**09/14/15 19:12**|  *dementor*| *page| 
|**09/14/15 19:14**|  *amrav*| Cool. Sorry about the delay.| 
|**09/14/15 19:14**|  *dementor*| There should ben issue tracker for pages. :confused:| 
|**09/14/15 19:14**|  *dementor*| I forgot all thngs I wanted to correct yesterday :confused:| 
|**09/14/15 19:14**|  *amrav*| Thats exactly what the talk page is supposed to be. You can add a TODO section.| 
|**09/14/15 19:14**|  *dementor*| I realised today and did today :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/14/15 19:17**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKGKRST>: When adding references, you can use ProveIt (on the bottom right side). Its much easier, and encourages consistency.| 
|**09/14/15 19:18**|  *amrav*| This only works in source edit mode, which you should be using if youre making a lot of edits, I think.| 
|**09/14/15 19:18**|  *dementor*| yea| 
|**09/14/15 19:18**|  *dementor*| Got it.| 
|**09/14/15 20:08**|  *amrav*| Spam alert: somebody changed everything on the HHFH page to refer to anime.| 
|**09/14/15 20:11**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKGKRST>: I meant you can use the Robotics pages Talk page to list tasks to be completed.| 
|**09/14/15 20:11**|  *amrav*| Your own talk page is meant for other people to message you on.| 
|**09/14/15 20:21**|  *dementor*| Oh| 
|**09/14/15 20:21**|  *amrav*| Wow, they persisted even after I rolled back the edit.| 
|**09/14/15 20:22**|  *amrav*| Ive protected the page to be editable only be registered users for one week.| 
|**09/14/15 20:23**|  *dementor*| dafuq?| 
|**09/14/15 20:23**|  *dementor*| Midsem frustapa's side effects :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/14/15 20:25**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: I would like to maintain my own todo somewhere so I think my talk seems to be the best place.| 
|**09/14/15 20:26**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKGKRST>: Instead, you can make a section on your user page, or you can create a subpage of your user page. Example: /w/User:Dementor/TODO.| 
|**09/14/15 20:33**|  *amrav*| <@U0AHSU2KF>: Whats the template for indicating a section is empty, and needs to be filled in?| 
|**09/14/15 20:51**|  *xtinct*| {{empty section}}|

|**09/14/15 20:55**|  *amrav*| Unfortunately, no. Hangouts doesnt show their email ids, and Slack doesnt let you send invites through a link.|

|**09/14/15 21:11**|  *amrav*| Random thought: what do you think about asking instiinfo guys to join us?| 
|**09/14/15 21:13**|  *dementor*| If they have the same intention as us then makes sense, but to me I smell that they plan to add ads on the website and earn over time.| 
|**09/14/15 21:13**|  *dementor*| Seems to me. I might be wrong.| 
|**09/14/15 21:19**|  *dementor*| Also, they are an information website. I don't think they care about the history. I prefer wiki because of that majorly.| 
|**09/14/15 21:24**|  *hargup*| I also think they plan to put ads on the website later, after we are more comprehensive they are redundant, but we should at least talk to them and see if they are interested in joining us.| 
|**09/14/15 21:26**|  *amrav*| Somehow, way more people know about instiinfo than metakgp.| 
|**09/14/15 21:28**|  *hargup*| They started out earlier and they were heavy on PR| 
|**09/14/15 21:28**|  *hargup*| we'll get popular too| 
|**09/14/15 21:29**|  *mitpal*| I think they are just trying to develop their web development or design skills. And create something useful out of it.| 
|**09/14/15 21:31**|  *mitpal*| Also it seems they are more inclined towards providing information than generating revenue. But of course we can always ask.| 
|**09/14/15 21:31**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: They put posters and notices in LBS, the largest resident hall on campus :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/14/15 21:34**|  *amrav*| Hmm. If they actually care about providing information, we might gain a few valuable contributors. Also, they seem to have done quite a bit of legwork, going to DepC students and such.| 
|**09/14/15 21:35**|  *amrav*| Clearly their website has a very different philosophy, but they may just not have thought of this one, or thought it would be viable.|

|**09/16/15 00:38**|  *himanshu*| wikimedia commons deleted the society logo and hall pic I uploaded. <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Orkohunter>| 
|**09/16/15 00:38**|  *himanshu*| :disappointed:| 
|**09/16/15 00:39**|  *himanshu*| How can we get society logos under CC?| 
|**09/16/15 01:20**|  *dementor*| We don't.| 
|**09/16/15 01:21**|  *dementor*| Refer to discussion on hangouts four days back, some users have been given the right to upload images on metakgp server itself which are copyright| 
|**09/16/15 01:21**|  *dementor*| mainly for logos.| 
|**09/16/15 01:21**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHQ8HD3> can explain how.| 
|**09/16/15 02:22**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKU18CW>: Which society is this? Our first preference is to get the logo under CC if possible.| 
|**09/16/15 02:39**|  *himanshu*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: TLS, Technology Literary Society <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Technology_Literary_Society>  I had uploaded the image and now it shows blank in the infobox because it has been deleted from the wikimedia commons| 
|**09/16/15 02:39**|  *amrav*| What license did you upload it under?| 
|**09/16/15 02:40**|  *himanshu*| umm.. I don't remember that.| 
|**09/16/15 02:40**|  *himanshu*| I must have clicked 'I don't own this' and 'I found this on internet'. Sorry I don't remember much about that.| 
|**09/16/15 03:13**|  *amrav*| Yeah, that option is a trap option, designed to make you confess that the image shouldnt be on Creative Commons.| 
|**09/16/15 03:13**|  *dementor*| ^lol| 
|**09/16/15 03:14**|  *amrav*| We should ask TLS to release their license under Creative Commons. If they dont want to, we can upload it under a restricted license.| 
|**09/16/15 03:15**|  *amrav*| (on the wiki directly, instead of through CC)| 
|**09/16/15 03:16**|  *dementor*| We should just assume that logos must go under restricted license I think.| 
|**09/16/15 03:18**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKGKRST>: I think we should try to convince people to release their stuff under CC first, since its good for everybody. We always have the fallback of uploading under a restricted license, but putting that up as the first option means that fewer people will think about releasing under CC.| 
|**09/16/15 03:19**|  *amrav*| Also, the more files that are on CC, the fewer we have to host (and backup, and restore in case of loss, etc)| 
|**09/16/15 03:21**|  *dementor*| Makes sense though but I think asking will make our work slow and will be redundant. From my perspective if I do not want TRS/CFER logo on CC, I do not think others would want logos to be on CC.| 
|**09/16/15 03:23**|  *amrav*| DebSoc was fine with a CC logo, so was Bitwise. I think its worth the additional delay, given that we advance the cause of freely available images. Many people probably wont even be aware of CC unless we talk to them about it.| 
|**09/16/15 03:23**|  *dementor*| Bitwise was :open_mouth:| 
|**09/16/15 03:23**|  *dementor*| I can so screw them now :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/16/15 03:24**|  *dementor*| But cool if we are ready to put in the additional delay.| 
|**09/16/15 07:05**|  *hargup*| I agree with <@U0AHQ8HD3>, one of our side aim is to increase awareness about open culture and licenses issues constitute a very important part of it.| 
|**09/16/15 07:08**|  *hargup*| I've written to Anurag Priyam and HJP to share the history of HiT Hi FiT Hai for metaKGP. Both of them have been admins for DC| 
|**09/16/15 09:44**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: Societies wouldn't have an issue with releasing their images under CC license but that's usually not the case when considering any other organization (famous specially). In such cases, a logo (or say signature of a famous person) can be released under _Fair Usage Policy_.| 
|**09/16/15 09:44**|  *xtinct*| But I think that allows the image _only_ to be used on Wikipedia (or the wiki it is uploaded to) and not on commons.| 
|**09/16/15 09:45**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AKU18CW>: When you upload logos on metaKGP wiki now, just tag them with Fair Usage license.| 
|**09/16/15 11:41**|  *hargup*| It turns out even Priyam doesn't know the history, he has CCed the mail to Naveen, I guess he is the guy from whom Priyam inherited the admin rights.| 
|**09/16/15 11:43**|  *hargup*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: : I've invited icyflame to this slack channel| 
|**09/16/15 12:03**|  *icyflame*| <@U0APA9ZUP icyflame> has joined the channel| 
|**09/16/15 14:44**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: You should set an icon for the slack team too. It is the default one. :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/16/15 17:02**|  *amrav*| Hi <@U0APA9ZUP>| 
|**09/16/15 17:02**|  *icyflame*| Hi <!channel> , thanks for adding me! :simple_smile:| 
|**09/16/15 17:03**|  *amrav*| <@U0AHSU2KF>: I've added the option for people in the "uploadaccess" group to be able to upload files directly to the wiki. When you do so, you get the option to use a non free license, for a logo. | 
|**09/16/15 17:07**|  *amrav*| <@U0APA9ZUP>: we really appreciated your contributions, and figured it would be  nice to have you more closely involved with day to day planning, if you want :) | 
|**09/16/15 17:09**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: Thanks a lot for the inclusion! Yes, certainly, I would be happy to be involved.| 
|**09/16/15 17:14**|  *amrav*| <@U0AJEBGBU>: Can you ask Priyam or Ram to make a page on KLUG? | 
|**09/16/15 17:20**|  *amrav*| Also, I'd like to propose a convention for listing achievements. If we need to list the winners of certain events, they should go into a table on the event's page (for example GC). Hall pages should not each re-list the winners from their halls, but instead link to the results table. They can however give aggregate statistics, or other commentary about the results. See for example the LBS page, that re-lists the winners of last year's GC events. | 
|**09/16/15 17:47**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: It's unlikely that they'll have time for it. Although, we can push it in the KLUG slack channel to be contributed by anyone who wants to.| 
|**09/16/15 17:47**|  *xtinct*| I am not quite inclined in the favor of this convention.| 
|**09/16/15 17:48**|  *hargup*| I guess we should do it ourselves and ask them for specific inputs| 
|**09/16/15 17:49**|  *xtinct*| We can list individual achievements and at the same time give a `See also` link to `List of all GC winners`. I guess that's how it is in general for most of Wikipedia's pages as well.| 
|**09/16/15 18:07**|  *icyflame*| What would be the best way to write a script that would act like a `rendering-correcter`?    (It would take a URL as input and then spit out corrected entry with following problems fixed)    - Fix phone number rendering  - Fix broken links to wikipedia (links that have been entered as `[[Google]]` instead of `[[wikipedia:Google ]]`)    Unless of course, there's a better way to do this!     We could have multiple scripts like these for different problems.    Opinions: <@U0AJEBGBU> , <@U0AHQ8HD3> ?| 
|**09/16/15 18:12**|  *amrav*| Can people like the Metakgp post on Facebook to get some traction?| 
|**09/16/15 18:13**|  *dementor*| ^What do you mean?| 
|**09/16/15 18:14**|  *amrav*| I just posted a "constitution fun fact on the Metakgp facebook page. If more people like it, itll gain visibility.| 
|**09/16/15 18:15**|  *amrav*| <@U0APA9ZUP>: Im not sure exactly how this would work, but you could look at writing a mediawiki bot.| 
|**09/16/15 18:15**|  *amrav*| I think they can do things like check for the existence of pages, and automatically correct dead links if theres something at that location in Wikipedia.| 
|**09/16/15 18:17**|  *amrav*| You should be able to fix phone number rendering through regexes, although it would be slightly tricky. Perhaps better is for the bot to simply flag what it detects as incorrectly formatted phone numbers.| 
|**09/16/15 18:17**|  *amrav*| Should be an interesting project.| 
|**09/16/15 18:18**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: Yeah, thanks! I will look into this!     Yes, it would certainly be an interesting project.| 
|**09/16/15 18:18**|  *dementor*| The gymkhana constitution page seems to reduce the average quality of metakgp :open_mouth:| 
|**09/16/15 18:19**|  *dementor*| Maybe we should volunteer to write it again :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/16/15 18:50**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKGKRST>: Hahaha| 
|**09/16/15 18:51**|  *dementor*| Point #17 You found 17 fun facts :open_mouth:| 
|**09/16/15 18:53**|  *amrav*| Nah, I just picked a random number, implying there were others to come :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/16/15 19:29**|  *xtinct*| <@U0APA9ZUP>: One way to achieve consistency is to extensively use templates. For example, create a `contact` template which when simply provided a number formats it according to the rules. These would loosely be what you call _rendering-correcter_. While, what we use are pretty simple ones, they can be pretty complicated based on how you code them using intricate Lua patterns.| 
|**09/16/15 19:32**|  *amrav*| I think what he means is how do we correct existing incorrectly formatted things automatically, although having a template for this makes a lot of sense. | 
|**09/16/15 19:32**|  *xtinct*| Templates are powered by Lua module, and it is should be easy to write on based on already existing templates (on Wikipedia) .| 
|**09/16/15 19:33**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: That's where big careful from start helps a bit. Otherwise, it will _certainly_ pile up as manual labor later.| 
|**09/16/15 20:36**|  *twistin*| <@U0AQ1LRBQ twistin> has joined the channel| 
|**09/17/15 00:05**|  *amrav*| <@U0AHSU2KF>: Nice work with the <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Subway> page!| 
|**09/17/15 00:41**|  *amrav*| The main page now has a Trending section, defined as the top ten landing pages ordered by number of new unique users over the last 7 days. A landing page is the page a visitor enters the website from. A new user is someone who hasnt visited the wiki before.| 
|**09/17/15 03:23**|  *hargup*| wow we used to have a KLUG back in 2004| 
|**09/17/15 03:23**|  *hargup*| <https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/slashkgp/info>| 
|**09/17/15 04:29**|  *hargup*| <!everyone>: I found this very old website from 2003 created by people in D-top wing in RK. <http://rkdtw.tripod.com/dtw/index.html>| 
|**09/17/15 04:32**|  *hargup*| They also have a link to a website of RK hall which ofcourse doesn't exist now. The website is so old that <http://archive.org archive.org> wasn't even born yet. :smile:| 
|**09/17/15 04:35**|  *hargup*| They also have some photographs of rangoli of their time <http://rkdtw.tripod.com/dtw/album1.html>| 
|**09/17/15 16:15**|  *dementor*| Interesting :open_mouth:| 
|**09/17/15 16:17**|  *dementor*| I was wondering, one of the most difficult tasks for a researcher is to find people working on similar fields in the world. So, to make things easier for Kgp. How about a reverse prof search? Like now, if you need, you need to go to a profs page and see about him and then do a linear search on all profs. What if we type interests and we get names of profs working on similar fields?| 
|**09/17/15 16:20**|  *dementor*| Also, on a parallel note, We should have a questionnaire format for alums to get more information about History of Kgp. Like I have lots of relatives who are alums and they have told me lots of stories too over 5 years about Kgp which are part of history but if I want to document it, I cant really think of it now. So maybe a questionnaire that we can ask them and then do whatever we want with them?| 
|**09/17/15 19:27**|  *himanshu*| A suggestion for the main page : What about having a section of 'Did you know...' on the main page with some antique or really cool facts/stories about any personality, place etc. which really makes the first visit little more interesting for a new user?  It's there on the Wikipedia main page. And having that for KGP will be cool. What do other people think about this?| 
|**09/17/15 19:29**|  *dementor*| +1 I think we can create a new channel to discuss these did you knows before deciding them to be put up| 
|**09/17/15 19:33**|  *amrav*| +1 This is similar to the constitution fun facts, but more general.| 
|**09/18/15 01:50**|  *hargup*| +1 for reverse prof search| 
|**09/18/15 01:55**|  *dementor*| <@U0AJEBGBU> I'm not sure on the best way to do this yet. Scraping kgp site sure is a way to start but something better you can think?| 
|**09/18/15 01:56**|  *hargup*| scraping <http://iitkgp.ac.in iitkgp.ac.in> should do it| 
|**09/18/15 01:56**|  *nuwanda*| We can scrape publications and research projects of all profs?| 
|**09/18/15 01:56**|  *nuwanda*| Yup, should be simple enough| 
|**09/18/15 01:56**|  *hargup*| pages of professors give their research areas| 
|**09/18/15 01:57**|  *nuwanda*| Yeah. Let's do this by the weekend?| 
|**09/18/15 01:57**|  *nuwanda*| Second metaX project, this can be| 
|**09/18/15 01:58**|  *hargup*| I'm in| 
|**09/18/15 01:58**|  *nuwanda*| Vikrant and I were discussing about making the box on mfqp a one stop person/place finder| 
|**09/18/15 01:59**|  *nuwanda*| This should be a good place to start| 
|**09/18/15 01:59**|  *nuwanda*| So, research projects, publications and courses they take here?| 
|**09/18/15 02:00**|  *nuwanda*| That should do, right?| 
|**09/18/15 02:00**|  *nuwanda*| We could also link everything back to the wiki and drive more traffic| 
|**09/18/15 02:04**|  *hargup*| True| 
|**09/18/15 02:04**|  *hargup*| mfqp website doesn't link back to metaKGP| 
|**09/18/15 02:04**|  *nuwanda*| Yup. We could have prof pages up and running.| 
|**09/18/15 02:04**|  *nuwanda*| And link everything back to that| 
|**09/18/15 02:13**|  *hargup*| another thing we can do is to give how "close" is your area of interest to the area of interest of some other prof. I'm hoping we'll be able to find some "distance matrix" for areas of research in existing research.| 
|**09/18/15 02:14**|  *hargup*| this can be extended to profs at foreign universities| 
|**09/18/15 02:19**|  *dementor*| I'm in too| 
|**09/18/15 02:21**|  *dementor*| But are we planning to make wiki pages of all profs?| 
|**09/18/15 02:21**|  *dementor*| Actually that's not a bad idea if it's automated which should be fairly easy| 
|**09/18/15 02:21**|  *dementor*| Since all profs have same page format| 
|**09/18/15 02:22**|  *nuwanda*| We should ideally have. Profs themselves can write about their research etc| 
|**09/18/15 02:22**|  *dementor*| But how do we create wiki pages like that? They need a captcha to be filled right?| 
|**09/18/15 02:22**|  *dementor*| Ooo a mass mail to Profs to do so?  :stuck_out_tongue: | 
|**09/18/15 02:23**|  *dementor*| But most will ignore actually| 
|**09/18/15 02:25**|  *nuwanda*| I was talking to vikrant about this. If we get one cool prof| 
|**09/18/15 02:25**|  *nuwanda*| it'll be so cool| 
|**09/18/15 02:26**|  *dementor*| DD or dean sa| 
|**09/18/15 02:26**|  *dementor*| Won't mind I think| 
|**09/18/15 02:26**|  *dementor*| Even dean alumni| 
|**09/18/15 02:27**|  *dementor*| Actually dean alumni| 
|**09/18/15 02:27**|  *dementor*| Would be best| 
|**09/18/15 02:27**|  *dementor*| He's awesome| 
|**09/18/15 02:27**|  *dementor*| He's kgp grad| 
|**09/18/15 02:27**|  *dementor*| He's friendly| 
|**09/18/15 02:27**|  *dementor*| And since our aim is to preserve history| 
|**09/18/15 02:27**|  *dementor*| This will be cool| 
|**09/18/15 02:27**|  *nuwanda*| let's reach out to him over the weekend?| 
|**09/18/15 02:27**|  *dementor*| Let's meet once over the weekend| 
|**09/18/15 02:28**|  *dementor*| To discuss our future endeavours| 
|**09/18/15 02:28**|  *dementor*| And divide stuff a bit| 
|**09/18/15 02:28**|  *nuwanda*| Vikrant won't be here. :confused:| 
|**09/18/15 02:28**|  *dementor*| Oh yea!| 
|**09/18/15 02:28**|  *dementor*| Poor him then. He is missing the excitement for food and ac | 
|**09/18/15 02:29**|  *dementor*| As we go out and change the world| 
|**09/18/15 02:29**|  *dementor*| :sunglasses: | 
|**09/18/15 02:29**|  *dementor*| He can join us on slack though| 
|**09/18/15 02:29**|  *dementor*| It can be integrated with <http://appear.in appear.in>| 
|**09/18/15 02:30**|  *nuwanda*| :grin:| 
|**09/18/15 02:34**|  *dementor*| I know. It's cool.| 
|**09/18/15 02:34**|  *dementor*| I think we should do that next week though| 
|**09/18/15 02:34**|  *dementor*| I don't think we should mail| 
|**09/18/15 02:35**|  *dementor*| We should meet them| 
|**09/18/15 02:35**|  *dementor*| And for deans it's better to take appointments| 
|**09/18/15 02:36**|  *nuwanda*| Cool. Let's meet and flesh this out| 
|**09/18/15 02:37**|  *dementor*| We should approach sidmuk as fifth years trying to "pen down the feel of kgp" so we don't miss it as much | 
|**09/18/15 02:37**|  *dementor*| :stuck_out_tongue: | 
|**09/18/15 02:37**|  *nuwanda*| XD| 
|**09/18/15 02:37**|  *nuwanda*| Whatever works man. :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/18/15 02:37**|  *dementor*| :joy: | 
|**09/18/15 02:38**|  *nuwanda*| We should approach him saying he is best| 
|**09/18/15 02:38**|  *dementor*| But we should know very well as what he wants from us| 
|**09/18/15 02:38**|  *dementor*| I mean what we want from me| 
|**09/18/15 02:38**|  *dementor*| I should sleep :confused: | 
|**09/18/15 02:39**|  *dementor*| From him| 
|**09/18/15 02:39**|  *dementor*| Ughh..| 
|**09/18/15 02:41**|  *nuwanda*| But I'm sure he knows what we want from you.| 
|**09/18/15 02:41**|  *nuwanda*| Comon somu| 
|**09/18/15 02:43**|  *dementor*| I'm off. I think I sleep texting which hasn't really helped me. | 
|**09/18/15 04:15**|  *himanshu*| <@U0AKGKRST>: I had such an embarrassing experience recently. I pushed a commit on GitHub during sleep and only after 8 hours I came to know that it contained some cryptic words which I don't remember typing. :confused:| 
|**09/18/15 08:32**|  *hargup*| That's funny :simple_smile:| 
|**09/18/15 08:36**|  *hargup*| <!everyone>: I think holacracy would be a good fit for metakgp. It is new organisational methodology which eliminates hierarchy of traditional organization but maintains structure and efficiency. Medium and a subsidy of Amazon called Zappos are a few big names which use holacracy. <https://static-cdn.blinkist.com/ebooks/Blinkracy-Blinkist.pdf>| 
|**09/18/15 09:40**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKGKRST>: Its not difficult to write a bot that will auto-create prof pages based on some template. Bots are exempt from captchas. These prof pages can also have semantic mark up that serves as a searchable, typed database. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_wiki.> That would also be a pretty awesome project to implement nationwide. Imagine being able to match research interests with profs from any institute, and then be able to see similar research projects, degrees of collaboration, etc.| 
|**09/18/15 09:47**|  *amrav*| Wikidata is another alternative to Semantic Wiki: <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page> (check out the showcase about Douglas Adams).| 
|**09/18/15 10:06**|  *dementor*| Awesome. Let's do this. :D| 
|**09/18/15 11:34**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: Automating the problem is hardly ever a rate limiting step in this case. The problem comes to having the right data (and a lot of it) in right place. But indeed, it'll be useful to have a framework from the start.| 
|**09/18/15 11:35**|  *xtinct*| Can we pitch VP to get small location trackers installed in buses in the context of extra security? I think institute buses ride outside campus as such and in such cases it might actually be a requirement than luxury.| 
|**09/18/15 11:35**|  *xtinct*| s/as such/as well| 
|**09/18/15 11:35**|  *dementor*| Lets just do it ourself :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/18/15 11:35**|  *dementor*| No one will ever know| 
|**09/18/15 11:35**|  *dementor*| :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/18/15 11:36**|  *xtinct*| Yeah. But we'll gain much larger audience and good will of people in former case.| 
|**09/18/15 11:36**|  *xtinct*| Which will be pretty cool.| 
|**09/18/15 11:38**|  *nuwanda*| dementor: Seems like you have some experience in installing location trackers, all by yourself.| 
|**09/18/15 11:38**|  *nuwanda*| :cold_sweat:| 
|**09/18/15 11:39**|  *dementor*| Lets not go there.   &lt;I am a secret agent by night&gt;| 
|**09/18/15 12:01**|  *xtinct*| Or the sudden thing can work out pretty well as well! yum :smile:| 
|**09/18/15 18:07**|  *dementor*| Hey, I am trying to write the KRSSG page but I want to add a new info to infobox called "Under SRIC"| 
|**09/18/15 18:08**|  *dementor*| How do I do that?| 
|**09/18/15 18:08**|  *amrav*| You can edit the society infobox template, and add this field.| 
|**09/18/15 18:10**|  *amrav*| But be careful about adding ad hoc fields. You should only add things to the template that are relevant to at least a few societies. How many pages will use the Under SRIC: yes/no label?| 
|**09/18/15 18:34**|  *dementor*| All Research Groups| 
|**09/18/15 18:34**|  *dementor*| AGv KRSSG| 
|**09/18/15 18:34**|  *dementor*| Quad| 
|**09/18/15 18:34**|  *dementor*| Swarm| 
|**09/18/15 18:34**|  *dementor*| AUV| 
|**09/18/15 18:55**|  *dementor*| And like MetaKgp can be a group if we call it on| 
|**09/18/15 18:55**|  *dementor*| *one| 
|**09/18/15 18:55**|  *dementor*| which is No for both| 
|**09/18/15 19:15**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHQ8HD3> Do you think we should make a new infobox for student research groups?| 
|**09/18/15 19:15**|  *dementor*| Since it should have professor names too.| 
|**09/18/15 19:16**|  *dementor*| Or just add another field in this ?| 
|**09/18/15 22:35**|  *dementor*| KRSSG Done.| 
|**09/18/15 22:35**|  *dementor*| <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/KRSSG>| 
|**09/18/15 22:35**|  *dementor*| Please proof-read| 
|**09/18/15 22:56**|  *dementor*| Re-organised Robotics page| 
|**09/18/15 22:56**|  *dementor*| Made CFER page.| 
|**09/19/15 03:23**|  *dementor*| How do I create pages?| 
|**09/19/15 03:23**|  *dementor*| I tried so hard to find an option to do so :confused:| 
|**09/19/15 05:55**|  *amrav*| It's a really strange interface. You need to type in the name of your new page in the search bar. Then, when it shows that no such page exists, you click on Create page. | 
|**09/19/15 05:56**|  *amrav*| Alternatively, you can type in the url of your new page directly.  Remember to use the right url encoded symbols for special characters :P| 
|**09/19/15 11:02**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: But the pro is that it prevents the 'let's create this' instinct of people without ever making an effort to search.| 
|**09/19/15 11:02**|  *xtinct*| Which is quite frequent in programming help forums, for example.| 
|**09/19/15 11:06**|  *xtinct*| Very nice work <@U0AKU18CW>!| 
|**09/19/15 11:07**|  *xtinct*| Arigato.| 
|**09/19/15 11:35**|  *amrav*| <@U0AHSU2KF> I can see the sense in that argument, but I think it dissuades people a bit too much. A better interface might be to let you type in the name of your new page, but then show you a list of search results and ask if you're sure it doesn't already exist. | 
|**09/19/15 11:36**|  *xtinct*| It's quite close to what you have said. But yeah, I'm not defending them :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/19/15 12:12**|  *amrav*| <@U0APA9ZUP>: See the discussion on <#C0AHUF5R7> a while back about convincing societies to release their logos under CC.| 
|**09/19/15 14:29**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: Yeah, I have gone through it now.| 
|**09/19/15 16:04**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHQ8HD3> I think its ben long and we should change the featured articles.| 
|**09/19/15 16:05**|  *dementor*| Constitution can be one.| 
|**09/19/15 16:08**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: What version of MediaWiki is the wiki currently running on?| 
|**09/19/15 16:09**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKGKRST>: Yeah, Ive been meaning to feature another article for a while now. Constitution is kind of long and boring, maybe its better to use it for fun facts. I want to feature the Robotics page (need to do some clean up), and the GC page (waiting for pictures).| 
|**09/19/15 16:09**|  *amrav*| <@U0APA9ZUP>: See Special:Version, its 1.24+| 
|**09/19/15 16:10**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: Do you have any plans of upgrading to 1.25 ? (There are saner defaults in the MediaWiki 1.25 API)| 
|**09/19/15 16:12**|  *dementor*| Which pictures are you waiting for?| 
|**09/19/15 16:12**|  *amrav*| Not immediately. Theres lots to be done in terms of just content, and upgrading will mean putting the wiki into read only mode for a day or two at least.| 
|**09/19/15 16:13**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKGKRST>: Pictures of GC events by the photo secretary. The page looks nice, but it can look really awesome with photos of ad design etc.| 
|**09/19/15 16:14**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: :+1: Thanks!| 
|**09/19/15 16:15**|  *dementor*| I see the GC page empty| 
|**09/19/15 18:56**|  *hargup*| wanna meet for Dinner tonight?| 
|**09/19/15 18:56**|  *himanshu*| Who's treat? :smile:| 
|**09/19/15 18:57**|  *hargup*| at RP/Azad's mess :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/19/15 18:57**|  *himanshu*| Wow! -_-| 
|**09/19/15 18:58**|  *himanshu*| +1| 
|**09/19/15 19:04**|  *dementor*| mess -_-| 
|**09/19/15 19:04**|  *dementor*| Carlos :confused:| 
|**09/19/15 19:05**|  *hargup*| Carlos bhi peace hai| 
|**09/19/15 19:06**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHU8RU0>: You?| 
|**09/19/15 19:07**|  *dementor*| Or we will barge into <@U0AHU8RU0> s room and ask Carlos to deliver there :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/19/15 19:32**|  *hargup*| <@U0AKGKRST>: I'll be there in 15 min| 
|**09/19/15 19:33**|  *dementor*| Cool| 
|**09/19/15 19:56**|  *himanshu*| I won't be able to make it there| 
|**09/19/15 20:07**|  *himanshu*| <@U0APA9ZUP> <@U0AJEBGBU>   The list posted here <http://noticeboard.iitkgp.ernet.in/bcrth/> doesn't seem to be complete.  Look at this, which is pasted on the OPD counter.  <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2b/List_of_doctors_BC_Roy_Sept_19_2015.pdf>  Can we get this somewhere on the site?| 
|**09/19/15 20:10**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AKU18CW>: As a matter of fact there are two levels to this list:    1. Visiting doctors: This list changes less often (has remained the same since July 2015)    2. General physicians (This list changes every week)| 
|**09/19/15 20:10**|  *icyflame*| The photo you have just uploaded is a merge of the two files 116.doc and 137.doc| 
|**09/19/15 20:11**|  *icyflame*| <@U0APA9ZUP icyflame> uploaded a file: <https://metakgp.slack.com/files/icyflame/F0B0CCY7L/116.doc 116.doc> and commented: Visiting doctors w.e.f July 2015        <http://noticeboard.iitkgp.ernet.in/bcrth/notice.php?sr_no=116>|

|**09/20/15 07:38**|  *xtinct*| The message board is interesting| 
|**09/20/15 07:38**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AKU18CW>: May be you can just try mailing the people who might be listed as incharge or whatever in those lists.| 
|**09/20/15 10:02**|  *amrav*| The wiki has its first masked vigilante <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/User:Batman>. Take a look at the history of the Kshitij page to see what it did. | 
|**09/20/15 11:45**|  *xtinct*| Sockpuppet? :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 11:53**|  *xtinct*| I guess Siddharth Agarwal is known enough to have his own page.| 
|**09/20/15 11:53**|  *xtinct*| (The Asidity guy)| 
|**09/20/15 11:54**|  *xtinct*| Known - with respect to media coverage.| 
|**09/20/15 11:55**|  *dementor*| Yea| 
|**09/20/15 11:56**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AJEBGBU>: I hope you are taking care of documenting the history of metaKGP itself.| 
|**09/20/15 11:56**|  *xtinct*| :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 12:13**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AKU18CW>: , <@U0AHSU2KF>: Although, Faculty Hub is a (really) interesting read ( :stuck_out_tongue: ) , what would we have to do with it?| 
|**09/20/15 12:13**|  *xtinct*| Nothing! :smile: have fun :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 12:13**|  *xtinct*| Argh. I always fuck up moves.| 
|**09/20/15 12:14**|  *icyflame*| Okay! :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 12:14**|  *icyflame*| And Batman ? Shell script ?| 
|**09/20/15 12:14**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AKGKRST>: Is ASID graduating this year or has he already?| 
|**09/20/15 12:14**|  *xtinct*| Also his department?| 
|**09/20/15 12:14**|  *himanshu*| Batman : Fight crimes. That was cool :simple_smile:| 
|**09/20/15 12:14**|  *dementor*| Indu| 
|**09/20/15 12:14**|  *dementor*| And graduated| 
|**09/20/15 12:14**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AKU18CW>: Just beat you in scores! :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 12:14**|  *xtinct*| B | 
|**09/20/15 12:15**|  *himanshu*| Hah! :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 12:15**|  *xtinct*| #LikeABoss| 
|**09/20/15 12:15**|  *himanshu*| Not even close in 'All time'| 
|**09/20/15 12:15**|  *xtinct*| Aim for 7 days and 30 days! :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 12:16**|  *himanshu*| hmm hmm  Let Mid sems end| 
|**09/20/15 12:16**|  *himanshu*| We'll do much better| 
|**09/20/15 12:16**|  *himanshu*| :simple_smile:| 
|**09/20/15 12:16**|  *xtinct*| Well well.| 
|**09/20/15 12:16**|  *xtinct*| Bring it on.| 
|**09/20/15 12:17**|  *himanshu*| :smile:| 
|**09/20/15 12:17**|  *himanshu*| <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/Siddharth_Agarwal>  Okay so we are making pages of important students of the campus.| 
|**09/20/15 12:18**|  *himanshu*| Cool| 
|**09/20/15 12:18**|  *xtinct*| He'a graduated now. So, very tiny chances of controversy. If any.| 
|**09/20/15 12:19**|  *himanshu*| It's good to put graduated people| 
|**09/20/15 12:19**|  *himanshu*| Like, we can make of Biswapati Sarkar and peers| 
|**09/20/15 12:20**|  *xtinct*| Yeah. Totally.| 
|**09/20/15 12:20**|  *xtinct*| If you look closely, there's just too much content waiting out there, crying to be written out somewhere.| 
|**09/20/15 12:20**|  *himanshu*| I can *feel* it| 
|**09/20/15 12:21**|  *xtinct*| *shivers(=*| 
|**09/20/15 12:21**|  *xtinct*| _chills_| 
|**09/20/15 12:21**|  *himanshu*| Why not a template for students?| 
|**09/20/15 12:21**|  *himanshu*| PS. How to make template?| 
|**09/20/15 12:21**|  *himanshu*| *infobox| 
|**09/20/15 12:21**|  *xtinct*| We don't need separate for students.| 
|**09/20/15 12:21**|  *xtinct*| Infobox Person should be sufficient.| 
|**09/20/15 12:22**|  *himanshu*| Oh, didn't see that| 
|**09/20/15 12:22**|  *xtinct*| It's pretty easy. Checkout the example of Infobox Hall.| 
|**09/20/15 12:22**|  *himanshu*| Can we use Wikipedia's template infobox? And how?| 
|**09/20/15 12:24**|  *xtinct*| You mean to import any infobox from Wikipedia?| 
|**09/20/15 12:24**|  *himanshu*| yes| 
|**09/20/15 12:24**|  *himanshu*| like I was writing for hospital. There's already one of that in wikipedia| 
|**09/20/15 12:24**|  *xtinct*| I must have imported it, I guess.| 
|**09/20/15 12:25**|  *xtinct*| Checkout all pages with Template prefix to ensure that you aren't duplicating it.| 
|**09/20/15 12:25**|  *xtinct*| If it's plain simple (no intricate module dependencies) you can simply copy paste the source.| 
|**09/20/15 12:25**|  *xtinct*| Otherwise, use Special:Export_Pages option from Wikipedia to export templates and then import on our site.| 
|**09/20/15 12:26**|  *himanshu*| A blank search of 'Template:' returns 27 of 310 results. Is there a special page where this is enlisted?| 
|**09/20/15 12:26**|  *xtinct*| Yeah.| 
|**09/20/15 12:26**|  *xtinct*| Checkout Special Pages section| 
|**09/20/15 12:27**|  *xtinct*| There you have more advanced options of listing out pages with a Prefix, or within a namespace and so on.| 
|**09/20/15 12:27**|  *xtinct*| Play around a bit with that area.| 
|**09/20/15 12:27**|  *himanshu*| hmm.. thanks| 
|**09/20/15 12:27**|  *xtinct*| The Special spot! :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 12:27**|  *himanshu*| :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 12:27**|  *himanshu*| I just go there for scores :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 13:00**|  *dementor*| Asid| 
|**09/20/15 13:00**|  *dementor*| Jittu| 
|**09/20/15 13:00**|  *dementor*| Bissu| 
|**09/20/15 13:00**|  *dementor*| But history kon bataega :confused:| 
|**09/20/15 13:01**|  *dementor*| I can write or get written for Asid| 
|**09/20/15 13:01**|  *dementor*| Rest no clue.| 
|**09/20/15 13:12**|  *xtinct*| I was wondering if we can get digitized photos or articles from the Nehru Museum.| 
|**09/20/15 13:12**|  *xtinct*| Under appropriate permissions, of course| 
|**09/20/15 13:13**|  *xtinct*| That'll be a great source of DYK articles as well.| 
|**09/20/15 13:13**|  *xtinct*| <http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/iitk-campus-served-as-an-american-airbase-during-world-war-ii/article7662639.ece>| 
|**09/20/15 13:24**|  *dementor*| Yes. We might. Oh oh that Prof is really cool.| 
|**09/20/15 13:24**|  *dementor*| I totally forgot about him.| 
|**09/20/15 13:24**|  *dementor*| He might love the idea of the wiki.| 
|**09/20/15 13:24**|  *dementor*| He's into collecting photos of kgp himself.| 
|**09/20/15 13:24**|  *dementor*| He's a civil guy| 
|**09/20/15 13:24**|  *dementor*| The Nehru Museum chairman.| 
|**09/20/15 13:25**|  *dementor*| Even the guy who sits there can help.| 
|**09/20/15 13:25**|  *dementor*| They are even trying to setup a workshop just for kids there.| 
|**09/20/15 13:25**|  *dementor*| DJ Sen| 
|**09/20/15 13:26**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHU8RU0> we can approach him too. He's also ppcs batch mate. They meet for drinks.| 
|**09/20/15 13:40**|  *dementor*| RP Page would be done.| 
|**09/20/15 13:40**|  *dementor*| I found the perfect person| 
|**09/20/15 13:41**|  *dementor*| :sunglasses:| 
|**09/20/15 13:56**|  *dementor*| We should write about the Dropbox Campus Cup| 
|**09/20/15 14:04**|  *amrav*| What's that? :O| 
|**09/20/15 14:05**|  *amrav*| <@U0APA9ZUP> It's a pywikibot. I saw that you made a bot too..  What does it do? | 
|**09/20/15 14:06**|  *icyflame*| Nothing yet! :stuck_out_tongue: I was just experimenting with the login actions, etc. I looked at `pywikibot` but didn't use it. I will give it a shot!| 
|**09/20/15 14:11**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>:  Check random channel.| 
|**09/20/15 15:27**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHSU2KF> What more headings should be there under a hall?| 
|**09/20/15 15:35**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AKGKRST>: Yes, we should totally talk to Nehru Museum guy. I'm free tomorrow and later, if need be.| 
|**09/20/15 15:35**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHU8RU0> <@U0AHQ8HD3> When are you guys free?| 
|**09/20/15 15:37**|  *amrav*| Im free any time, but Im not in KGP :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 15:37**|  *xtinct*| Oh! :stuck_out_tongue: That's why you left the Friday exam in such hurry. <@U0AHQ8HD3>| 
|**09/20/15 15:37**|  *dementor*| Well, free included that clause| 
|**09/20/15 15:38**|  *dementor*| -_-| 
|**09/20/15 15:38**|  *dementor*| :expressionless:| 
|**09/20/15 16:01**|  *amrav*| <@U0AHSU2KF>: No no, I left early because I answered all the questions. Correctly, and without need for revision.| 
|**09/20/15 16:27**|  *xtinct*| Nothing less to expect from you!| 
|**09/20/15 19:11**|  *himanshu*| In how much time we can get metakgp in attention of the director? If he shares it on facebook, that would be a great boost up for the site.| 
|**09/20/15 19:37**|  *xtinct*| <@U0AKU18CW>: I have granted you auto patrolled user right.| 
|**09/20/15 19:37**|  *xtinct*| Which means that your edits will no longer be red flagged.| 
|**09/20/15 19:38**|  *amrav*| <@U0AHSU2KF>: Only sysops can see unpatrolled flags.| 
|**09/20/15 19:38**|  *xtinct*| I thought all autoconfirmed users can see that.| 
|**09/20/15 19:39**|  *xtinct*| Hmm.| 
|**09/20/15 19:48**|  *himanshu*| Well, thank you <@U0AHSU2KF>|

|**09/20/15 19:54**|  *himanshu*| Comments are welcome :simple_smile:  <https://wiki.metakgp.org/w/User:Orkohunter/The_Zen_of_metaKGP>| 
|**09/20/15 20:46**|  *amrav*| <!everyone>: Anyone who wants to get push notifications every time the wiki is updated, subscribe to the <#C0B0WPURY> page. Warning: may be disruptive sometimes.| 
|**09/20/15 20:49**|  *amrav*| If anyone has any suggestions for when youd rather be updated, Id be glad to hear them. One thing Ive been thinking about is pinging a Slack channel whenever an article is edited with misspelled words. It would be cool to be able to type `@batman: s/recnt/recent`.| 
|**09/20/15 20:50**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: You are planning something like Hubot for Wiki? :smile:  That would be awesome.| 
|**09/20/15 20:52**|  *amrav*| I hadnt heard of Hubot, but the idea seems similar.| 
|**09/20/15 20:52**|  *amrav*| It would be cool for many tasks to be able to discuss on Slack, come to some consensus, and then ask Batman to just do it.| 
|**09/20/15 20:55**|  *dementor*| Ooo That sounds so cool| 
|**09/20/15 21:30**|  *icyflame*| Yeah, that's what hubot is all about, too! gh uses it internally in their campfire rooms.| 
|**09/20/15 21:44**|  *amrav*| Any feature requests for Batman?| 
|**09/20/15 21:44**|  *dementor*| Give my exam tomorrow?| 
|**09/20/15 21:52**|  *amrav*| Ah crap. That will take at least 2 days to implement. Sorry.| 
|**09/20/15 22:03**|  *batman*| <@U0B0YFA23 batman> has joined the channel|

|**09/20/15 22:15**|  *amrav*| Try `Ctrl-Shift-R`?| 
|**09/20/15 22:16**|  *twistin*| That is my `readability` short command :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 22:16**|  *twistin*| you mean?| 
|**09/20/15 22:17**|  *amrav*| I mean try clearing your cache?| 
|**09/20/15 22:17**|  *twistin*| Awesome :smile:| 
|**09/20/15 22:18**|  *amrav*| Did it work?| 
|**09/20/15 22:18**|  *twistin*| Yup..  ^_^| 
|**09/20/15 22:24**|  *dementor*| We should feature a hall soon to inspire other halls. :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 22:24**|  *dementor*| &lt;Read Instigate&gt;| 
|**09/20/15 22:27**|  *twistin*| I support this idea.   After mid sems, LLR is going to have a full featured page. Hall President seems to 'know' stuff. -- Mostly word-to-mouth. .. How to verify it?| 
|**09/20/15 22:29**|  *amrav*| I think its sufficient (if its not _too_ controversial) for him to have a wiki account, and put a verified tag on it.| 
|**09/20/15 22:35**|  *twistin*| okay. and there are 'tales'. Not all are controversial... :stuck_out_tongue:| 
|**09/20/15 22:38**|  *dementor*| RP is done on things that was needed to be from a source I guess. Rest we can do.| 
|**09/20/15 22:38**|  *dementor*| We just need to put the Hall Council list| 
|**09/20/15 22:39**|  *dementor*| And names of HPs and Wardens. That is public information.| 
|**09/20/15 22:40**|  *dementor*| Just needs to be filled. I will do it tomorrow.| 
|**09/21/15 00:00**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: I have setup the script again, but the CORS request is getting rejected.|

|**09/21/15 00:01**|  *icyflame*| And the console, to see the CORS rejected message.|

|**09/21/15 00:50**|  *himanshu*| Getting an error while editing a page. Is it expected right now?| 
|**09/21/15 00:51**|  *himanshu*| Resolved with 4 reloads| 
|**09/21/15 00:57**|  *amrav*| <@U0AKU18CW>: Hmm. Sorry, could have been something I was messing around with.| 
|**09/21/15 00:57**|  *himanshu*| Peace :simple_smile:| 
|**09/21/15 00:58**|  *icyflame*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: Don't you think we should add the `Metakgp:Conventions` page to the sidebar, as well as the `New Editor` guide?| 
|**09/21/15 00:59**|  *amrav*| Conventions should be linked to from the NEG, which should go on the sidebar, yeah.| 
|**09/21/15 01:00**|  *amrav*| Analytics tells me that _no one_ has ever gone to the NEG from the Main Page. Thats depressing.| 
|**09/21/15 01:00**|  *amrav*| <@U0AHU8RU0>| 
|**09/21/15 15:14**|  *dementor*| <@U0AHQ8HD3>: It is easy to get things written by people but how to get things verified? I mean who shall have the right to verify? Also, the person who should how to get him to do it :confused:| 
|**09/21/15 15:29**|  *twistin*| I think a 'system' for verification via email would be viable in long run. The User sends an email (generated by MetaKGP wiki) to the person who is going to verify. (Or he thinks, has the right to verify). (perhaps gmail integration would help?)    The Email contains :  1.  link to the page, content of the page, too?  2. Some verification link... ( 'I hereby say that this is authentic.. to the best of my knowledge.. types?)   3. more?    Of course, 'he thinks' the right to verify. (Alumni verification is important. Not all would Want to make an account, I suppose. no?)| 
|**09/21/15 15:32**|  *dementor*| ^Exactly my concern.| 
|**09/21/15 15:53**|  *twistin*| Verification Right determination -   ---    1. Person linked with the event (Involved, directly or indirectly (Now, indirectly... is a contentious issue... use something like 'association factor' ? ... like LinkedIn?). Author/editor decides the 'connection' of the person with the event...)   2. For 'crowd-participation' event, number of verifications are important.  3.  Hall of residence info - Hall President ? Hall council?   4.  Gymkhana info - G. Secs.?   5.  ??    In all cases, Alumni verification could be helpful. Determining Alumni - User's/Author's responsibility? Or could we take the data from Alumni Cell ... and give User some hints?    Having 'corollary rights' (Administrative/management bodies linked to something.. ) and 'determined rights'(by User) could help.  metaKGP wiki could suggest User about 'corollary rights'.    Suggestions Welcome :simple_smile: |
